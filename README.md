# ‚ö° PyTorch Mastery

This repository documents my learning journey through the [Deep Learning in PyTorch Skill Track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/deep-learning-in-python) on DataCamp. It's designed to reinforce mastery over PyTorch and its applications in deep learning ‚Äî from foundational training loops to advanced image generation with GANs and transformer-based NLP.

## üß† Skill Track Overview

The complete track includes 6 comprehensive courses:
1. **Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch**
2. **Training Robust Neural Networks**
3. **Image and Text Data with PyTorch**
4. **Projects: Computer Vision with PyTorch**
5. **Natural Language Processing with PyTorch**
6. **Transformer Architectures with PyTorch**
